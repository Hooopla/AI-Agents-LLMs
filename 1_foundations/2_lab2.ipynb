      "You are advising the health minister of a middle-income country (population 20 million, limited ICU capacity) facing an emergent respiratory virus with uncertain characteristics. Three policy options are under active consideration: (A) an immediate, strict nationwide lockdown for 12 weeks (estimated transmission reduction ~70%, severe economic contraction, increased non-COVID health harms); (B) focused protection of high-risk groups combined with moderate public measures (estimated transmission reduction ~35%, smaller economic hit, higher chance of sporadic outbreaks); (C) maintaining current light measures while accelerating rapid vaccine procurement and distribution expected in ~6 months (requires maintaining capacity and public compliance until vaccines arrive). Using explicit assumptions and indicating uncertainty ranges, do the following: (1) recommend a primary strategy and a fallback plan under each of three plausible prior scenarios for transmissibility and severity (low, medium, high), explaining why; (2) for each strategy and each prior scenario, estimate and compare the likely ranges of total deaths, peak ICU demand relative to capacity, and GDP loss over 12 months, and identify the most important parameters driving those estimates; (3) list the minimal, high-priority data you would collect in the next 2â€“4 weeks (including how to measure them), explain how each datum would change your posterior beliefs and potentially alter the recommended strategy, and describe how you would assess data quality and biases; (4) propose a clear, operational adaptive decision rule (with quantitative thresholds and time windows) that dictates when to escalate, relax, or switch strategies, and explain how you would monitor for early warning signals and unintended harms; and (5) discuss the key ethical trade-offs (including equity across socioeconomic groups, intergenerational justice, and non-COVID health harms) and how those ethical considerations alter your recommended policy and the weighting of outcomes.\n"
